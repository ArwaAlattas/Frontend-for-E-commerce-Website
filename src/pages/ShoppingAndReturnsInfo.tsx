      <h2>Shipping Information</h2>
      <p>At Impresso, we prioritize preparing and shipping our customers` orders as quickly as possible according to the following points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>During the weekdays, we prepare and package orders within 1-3 business days and hand them over to the shipping company on the same day or the next business day.</li>
        <li>Orders placed on Fridays will not be shipped until Saturday due to the weekend break for shipping companies.</li>
        <li>Shipments typically reach the customer within 1 to 5 days after shipping, depending on the customer`s city from our store`s location in Buraydah and the distance from the nearest main distribution center of the shipping company. (This period may be extended due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 virus.)</li>
        <li>Customers will receive a text message or an email containing the order number and tracking number (after the shipping policy is issued by our store) and can track the shipment using the tracking number on the shipping company`s website.</li>
        <li>If no message or email with the information is received, please contact us to obtain the tracking number.</li>
        <li>Entering the correct address and contact number is the customer`s responsibility, and we will not be responsible for non-receipt of the shipment due to an error in the customer`s data.</li>
        <li>Tracking the shipment with the shipping company is the customer`s responsibility, and the shipment must be received on time from the shipping company before it is returned to the store.</li>
        <li>If the shipment returns to the store due to non-receipt by the customer, they will bear the shipping and return costs.</li>
        <li>Shipping is available to Gulf countries and takes 3 to 7 business days.</li>
        <li>We may need to change the shipping company as needed.</li>
